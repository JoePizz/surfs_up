1. Overview
The investor W.Avy is interested in investing in our surf and ice cream shop. They have opened one of their own in the past but it failed in part to poor weather driving customers away. This is why W.Avy sees a large correlation between weather patterns and the success of this Surf and Ice Cream shop. The purpose of this analysis is to find temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream business can be operational year-round.

2. Results
	1. The temperature in December and June is warm enough to attract people to want to surf and enjoy an ice cream. While December is slightly colder on average, it is only 	colder by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit, which I believe is not a large enough drop in temperature to deter people from surfing and eating ice cream.
	2. Approximately 99% of temperatures measurements in June were above 68 degrees Fahrenheit and about 84% of temperature measurements were above 68 degrees Fahrenheit in 	the month of December. At 68 degrees people are still very likely to go to the beach, showing that in each of these months there will be more than enough optimal 		temperature days that will attract people to go surfing.

	3. There is a change in the standard deviation from June to December, meaning that the temperature is more likely to fluctuate from the mean in the month of December 		than it is in June. However, this change is not large enough where it should be a concern with respects to whether or not a surf shop can be open all year round.


3. The results have shown us that there is a change in temperature from June to December in Oahu and that the precipitation does drop from June to December as well. However, the temperature difference between the 2 months is not large enough to deter people from going to the beach and surfing.
	2 additional queries: 	-On average how long the rain lasted each day? For example in parts of Florida it will rain almost everyday, but the rain does not last very long 				and thus isn't a very big deterrent for people to go out to the beach.
				-When does the sunset for each month? People are most likely not going to be hanging around the beach when it gets dark outside. Determining when 				the sun sets will help you to adjust your closing hours as well as staffing hours.
